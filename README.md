## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## Useful resources

- [HTML <picture> Tag - w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_picture.asp) - This helped me because the only way I knew how to change an image with media-queries was to use the image as background of a div. I think it makes more sense, semantically, to use the <picture> tag.
- [Uses for media-queries](https://web.dev/learn/design/media-queries/) - This is an amazing article which taught me some aspects about the media-queries that I didnÂ´t know before reading it.
